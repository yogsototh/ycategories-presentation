<h2>Definition: Functor</h2>

<p> A functor is a mapping between two categories.
Let \(\C\) and \(\D\) be two categories.
A <em>functor</em> \(\F\) from \(\C\) to \(\D\):</p>
<ul>
    <li> Associate objects: \(A\in\ob{\C}\) to \(\F(A) \in\ob{\D}\) </li>
    <li> Associate morphisms: \(f:A\to B\) to \(\F(f) : \F(A) \to \F(B)\)
        such that
        <ul>
            <li>\( \F (\id_X) = \id_{\F(X)} \),</li>
            <li>\( \F (g \circ_\C f) = \F(g) \circ_\D \F(f) \)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
