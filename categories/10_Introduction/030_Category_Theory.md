- Central position in contemporary mathematics/computer science/physics.
- General mathematical theory of structures and of systems of structures.
- Still evolving, developing, expanding and multiplying.
- At minimum, powerful language, or conceptual framework.
- Object of philosophical study and a potentially powerful formal tool.
- Alternative to set theory as a foundation for mathematics.
- Raises many issues about mathematical ontology and epistemology.
