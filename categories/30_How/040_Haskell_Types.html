<h2 id="haskell-types">Haskell Types</h2>
<p>We can make function that can work for <em>all</em> type parameter. Such function can only work with the <em>topology</em> induced by the type. We know such function won't work <em>on</em> the elements.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the type determine a lot about the function:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>fst :: (a,b) -> a -- Only one choice
snd :: (a,b) -> b -- Only one choice
f :: a -> [a]     -- Many choices
-- Possibilities: f x=[], or [x], or [x,x] or [x,...,x]

? :: [a] -> [a] -- Many choices
-- can only duplicate/remove/reorder elements
-- for example: the type of addOne isn't [a] -> [a]
addOne l = map (+1) l</code></pre>
