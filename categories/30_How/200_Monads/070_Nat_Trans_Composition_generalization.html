<p>Of course, we want ◎ to work like a composition. Then it should have a neutral element and be associative.</p>
<ul>
<li>(h ◎ g) ◎ f = h ◎ (g ◎ f)</li>
<li>η ◎ f = f = f ◎ η</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the first rule and the definition of ◎ it follows that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>join (join (F (F (F a)))) = join (F (join (F (F a))))</code></li>
<li>abusing notations for <code>join</code> it is equivalent to<br /> (F ⊙ F) ⊙ F = F ⊙ (F ⊙ F)</li>
</ul>
<p>The second rule fix the type of <code>η :: a -&gt; F a</code>.</p>
