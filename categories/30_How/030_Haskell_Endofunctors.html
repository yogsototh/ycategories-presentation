<h2>Haskell Endofunctors</h2>

In \(\Hask\) a functor should transform Haskell types and functions.

F :: * -> *

       Int ===> F Int
Int -> Int ===> F (Int -> Int)
       [a] ===> F [a]
       F a ===> F (F a)

Int -> Int ---(+)---> Int ====> F (Int -> Int) ---- fmap (+) ----> F Int

If F Hask included in Hask. F is said to be an endofunctor.

<pre class="nohighlight"><code>
Hask loop F Hask

Int ===> F Int
a -> b ====> F (a -> b)
...
</code></pre>

In Haskell type of type * -> * works naturally on types.

<pre class="haskell"><code>
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing -- For example
x :: Maybe Int
x = Just 10
y :: Maybe Int
y = Nothing
z :: Maybe ([a] -> a)
z = Just head

data F a = Cons Char a | Nil -- For example
toto,titi,tata :: F Int
toto = Cons 'c' 10
titi = Nil
tata :: F ([a] -> a)
tata = Cons 'a' head
</code></pre>
