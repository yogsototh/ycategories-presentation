This is just my personal branch for [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js) presentation.

It doesn't need an Internet connexion to work.
All js and fonts are copied locally.


I added:

- [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme
- [highlight.js](softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en) for code highlighting
- [MathJax](www.mathjax.org) for displaying math

Bonus:

- An optional ad hock generation tool to organize slides in subdirectories.
- An optional [metapost](www.tug.org/metapost.html) generator with my own graph drawing library to create perfect images.

Also use:

- [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js) of course!
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com)
